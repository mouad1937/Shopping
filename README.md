Subclass      -overrides the inherited/-Adds one new method




Public     - members are inherited , we use inheritance when one class is a more specific type of a superclass.
when that should be shared among multiple classes of the same general type.

private    -members are not inherited , reuse code from another class.



we can not change an argument in an overriding method! is a legal overload , but not an overRides.
